# Ricochet-Realm

RicochetRealm is a 2D top-down game where the player's objective is to shoot a ball into a hole with a minimum amount of bounces to pass each level. The game is built entirely from scratch with no frameworks or 3rd party libraries, and the graphics are entirely in text characters. The primary purpose of this project is to learn the fundamentals of game development by programming everything from scratch. RicochetRealm provides a fun and challenging experience while also serving as an educational resource for those seeking to deepen their understanding of game programming.
